Entryâ€‘level Data Analyst with a forecasting background. Handsâ€‘on with SQL, Power BI (DAX/M), Python (Pandas), and data storytelling. Built sales & operations dashboards and contributed to ~+10% forecastâ€‘accuracy via seasonality and standardized inputs.

### Highlights / Achievements  
- Contributed to +10% forecastâ€‘accuracy by standardizing inputs and integrating seasonality into analysis & dashboards.

- Power BI storytelling dashboards (cards â†’ trends â†’ drillâ€‘through) improving business visibility and reducing manual reporting.

- ETL automation with VBA/Power Query, cutting report prep time (fill actual: â†“X%).

**Tech Stack**: SQL Â· Power BI (DAX/M) Â· Python (Pandas/Matplotlib) Â· Excel/Power Query Â· Star Schema Â· Basic ML/Forecasting

### Projects
#### **Power BI Sales & Operations â€” Storytelling Dashboard**  
**Goal**: Give leadership and planners a clear narrative of performance (Sales/Inventory/Delivery) within 30 seconds.  
**Dataset**: Orders/Items, Customers, Products, Dates (sample or anonymized real structure).  
**Model**: Star Schema (Fact Orders/Items; Dim Customers/Products/Dates).  
**Key KPIs**: Gross Sales, Margin, Stock Coverage, Stockout Rate, OTIF/Lead Time.  
**Visual Design**: Cards â†’ Trend â†’ Drillâ€‘through; roleâ€‘based pages (Director / Sales / Ops).  
**Performance**: load < 3s (fill); refresh daily/weekly (fill); adoption +N MAU (fill).  
Stack: Power BI, DAX/M, SQL, Power Query.  

#### **Python â€” EDA (Roller Coaster Design Evolution)**

**Goal:** Clean the dataset and uncover actionable insights about coaster designs over time.  
**Tools & Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `ydata_profiling`  

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (Pandas)
- Exploratory visualizations (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Aggregation & basic statistics
- Correlation analysis & decade-based trend analysis
- Automated reporting with `ydata-profiling`

**Highlights / Findings**
- Coaster **speed** and **height** have **increased significantly** across decades.
- **Steel vs. wooden** coasters show **distinct design trends** (speed/height/inversions).
- Modern coasters are not only **faster** but also **more intense** (higher **G-force**).

**Repo Tips (optional)**
- Put the CSV in `data/`, notebook in `notebooks/01_eda_coasters.ipynb`, screenshots in `reports/screenshots/`.
- Export an HTML profiling file as `reports/EDA_Report.html` for quick review.
#### **Smart Loan Recovery System - Machine Learning**
**Features**:   
- Data visualization using Plotly  
- Data preprocessing pipeline  
- Clustering borrowers via KMeans  
- Classification using RandomForest  
- Evaluation metrics & model export  
- Modular structure for maintainability  

**Model Training & Evaluation**:
